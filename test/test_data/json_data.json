Students will understand the concepts and the scientific method as it applies to a systems-based, transdisciplinary approach to sustainability, and will be prepared to identify problems in sustainability and formulate appropriate solutions based on scientific research, applied science, social and economic issues. The basic concepts of life cycle assessment (LCA) will be discussed, along with life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) including the social and economic dimensions. The application of life cycle assessment methodology using appropriate case studies will be presented.",

There are occasional lectures and discussions to highlight particularly interesting observations of insects. Student evaluation is based on the student's insect collection and associated logbook, a written paper describing their experiment, contributions to class discussions and activities, and peer evaluation. The field site is generally in the USA or South America. Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies, and transportation to the field site(s).

The relationship of horses with humans will be explored from ancient through to modern times, including breeding for specific equestrian sports, prominent horsemen/women, and the variety of career options. Current issues will be explored including economic status and hot topics in the industry. Students may expect early morning and some weekend assignments. Students must provide their own grooming kit.",

Are some of an object's properties essential to it? Metaphysics is the business of proposing and debating answers to these questions and related questions.

This is a two-semester (F-W) course in which students apply their knowledge and skills through independent research of an experimental or theoretical nature within physics. Students will be required to present their results in both oral and written reports. Students must make arrangements with a faculty supervisor and obtain approval of the course co-ordinator before course selection. Approval of the course co-ordinator will only be granted upon receipt of a completed registration form, available from the co-ordinator during the course selection period. This is a two-semester course offered over consecutive semesters. When you select it, you must select PHYS*4001 in the Fall semester and PHYS*4002 in the Winter semester. A grade will not be assigned to PHYS*4001 until PHYS*4002 has been completed.",

The course is held at the Huntsman Marine Science Centre, St. Andrews, New Brunswick. The ecology, behaviour, physiology, biochemistry, biomechanics of marine plants and animals will be studied as well as basic oceanographic techniques. Students will be able to familiarize themselves with the techniques and equipment involved in various branches of marine biology and oceanography. In addition to regular tuition fees, students are responsible for the cost of transportation to St. Andrews, and for charges levied by the Huntsman Marine Science Centre for room and board. These fees are paid to Student Finance and Awards of the University of Guelph. A department application form must be submitted for approval before course selection. The signature of the course coordinator is required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly. Students taking this course DO NOT use course numbers reserved for Ontario Universities Program in Field Biology.",

The remainder of the course will be organized around specific contemporary problems in vertebrate biology such as the evolution of endothermy; feeding strategies and metabolism; locomotion and migration; trends in vertebrate reproduction; evolution of brain size and complexity in relation to cognition and communication. Each problem will be explored through analyses of taxonomic diversity, historical and phylogenetic constraints, physiological and developmental causes, and functional effects.",
